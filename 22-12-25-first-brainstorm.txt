my first intuitions on this problem:

part 1:
input--- 2d matrix; output---integer;
u are given a 2d matrix
then u wanna go to each roll of paper and find its 8 neighbours
if there are <4 rolls of paper in those 8 neighbours then add it to the target variable
for corner cases, u must take care, they hv only 3 or 5
like at corners only 3
at edges not corner its 5

flattening was my first thought
but its a bad idea cuz corners and edges

ok ill implement a search algorithm to each roll of paper first
