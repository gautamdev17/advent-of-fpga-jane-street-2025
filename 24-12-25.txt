my approach is very software oriented
if(mat[i][j] == '@') begin
    if(j==0) begin
        if(i==0) begin // corner case

        end
        else if(i==depth-1) begin // corner case

        end
        else begin // edge case

        end
    end
    else if(i==0) begin
        if(j==0) begin // corner case

        end
        else if(j==depth-1) begin // corner case

        end
        else begin // edge cases

        end
    end
    else begin //normal case

    end
end

    so ill restrart
    do i really care whether it is a corner or edge or do i only care whether a neighbor exists or not
    i only care whether a neighbor index is valid

a roll is accessible if
among its 8 surrounding positions
fewer than 4 contain @

so instead of asking
	am i a corner?
    am i an edge?

i should ask for each neighbor

do u exist? if yea then are u a @?

started with design 2

i think its a really easy problem

im thinking of convolutional neural networks, i find the similar to that
maybe a filtering layer is what i need

what do i need to filter?
everytime i hit a '@'
check-->valid neighbours-->'@'

thats all

bro all i need is an offset algorithm and check each neighbour

if the offset + the index === valdi?
    then go for it and check if @
