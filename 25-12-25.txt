i was thinking of a new model to part 2 when sleeping

lets make it sequential
each step is controlled by a clock

we cant use part 1 directly
modify it
and use it

so part 1 should be like a function
input matrix--->output matrix, total removal of @

top module should control the flow
take in the 1st given input matrix
feed it to part 1 hardware, send that as stimulus
then get outputs,increment total removal

then push back the output matrix as input
if removal≠0
or else removal=0
u should stop
but how
we cant have breaks in hardware synthesis


one clock is like on full sweep
