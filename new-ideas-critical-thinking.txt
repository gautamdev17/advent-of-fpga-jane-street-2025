    i still dont think my solution to part 1 is fpga friendly
    yes it is to an extent, i hv removed software oriented if-else nested loops and brought
    convolution style solution
    but those negative indices and replacing the character comparisons to binary can bring better
    fpga synthesis
    dynamic checking feels bad
2:45 pm
    did some research and found this, i have also attached ss for future reference

    // RESEARCH, GOOGLE
    Dynamic checking is generally considered "bad" for FPGAs primarily because it
    introduces significant performance overhead, increases power consumption,
    and consumes valuable logic resources that are better utilized for the core application.
    The fundamental nature of FPGAs is optimized for static, parallel hardware execution,
    not the sequential, conditional operations typical of dynamic software checking. 
    // CHECK THIS //

    if ((i+oi)>=0&&(i+oi)<depth && (j+oj)>=0&&(j+oj)<width) begin 
    
    i hate this above line
    maybe i can choose a wire type to keep it static

    to sum up
    1. i dont want negative indices --- > for (oi=-1;oi <= 1;oi =oi+1) be
    2. change all those dynamic checks to static wires
    4. @ to 1 and . to 0
    5. check once again for latches inferred

    so my idea is to make some net elements for each neighbour
    if the neighbour is @ it will be set to 

3:45pm: 
    edits were made in the design 4 file and made the design more hardware friendly
